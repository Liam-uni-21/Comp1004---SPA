# Comp1004 - SPA
I have created a Single Page Application (SPA). Itâ€™s designed to help with memory retention through interactive learning, including quizzes, flashcards, and a self-review dashboard. The goal of the project was to explore how digital tools can improve study habits and academic performance.
The application allows users to:

Complete pre-made quizzes to test their knowledge.

Use flashcard sets and to let users create their own flashcard sets.

Allow the user to self-review the quizzes/tasks they had completed.

Use a timer to encourage breaks as to prevent burnout.

All data is stored using localStorage, allowing persistent user progress without requiring backend integration. The interface is dynamic and responsive, utilizing JavaScript and jQuery for real-time updates and interaction without reloading the page.

This project was built using the Agile methodology, with seven sprints throughout the development process. Key design decisions and features were adapted through continuous iteration and self-reflection, with a focus on user accessibility and functionality.
